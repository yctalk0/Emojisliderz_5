## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#2962FF), reminiscent of WhatsApp, conveying trustworthiness and communication.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated blue (#D2E2FF), a lighter tint of the primary color to maintain visual harmony without overwhelming the bright emojis.
- Accent color: Bright yellow (#FFDA63), analogous to blue, is used for interactive elements like buttons to attract user attention and give an optimistic, accessible feel.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, is clean, modern, and friendly. It can be used for both the game's headlines and body text.
- Use large, clear icons for in-game actions such as hint, undo, and level selection; to be highly visible and intuitive.
- Copy the tile layout from the reference image, with numbered tiles in a clear grid with obvious borders
- Use smooth, quick slide animations with a playful 'bounce' at the end; use confetti, sparkles and joyful effects on the win screen to deliver satisfying positive feedback.
